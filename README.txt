Test Cases for Project 3: Shortest Paths (Dijkstra & Bellman-Ford)

Each file contains:
- First line: number of nodes n, number of edges m
- Next m lines: edges in format u v w
- Last line: source node

Test1.txt — Small positive-weight graph
Test2.txt — Graph with unreachable node
Test3.txt — Negative edge, no negative cycle
Test4.txt — Negative cycle reachable
Test5.txt — Undirected graph (converted to directed)
Test6.txt — Larger positive-weight graph
Test7.txt — Multiple negative edges, no cycle
Test8.txt — Disconnected graph with negative edge
Test9.txt — Self-loop negative edge
Test10.txt — Large positive-weight graph

Notes:
- "inf" represents an unreachable node.
- "None" represents no predecessor.
